    <p>This power up gives Pac-Man the ability to blow ice at his enimies and freeze them. Ghosts too can get frozen if Pac-Man uses his power up on them.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    2)Elder Berry

    <p>This power up gives Pac-Man the ability to have more strength, climb buildings, and transform into an ape. Sort of like King Kong.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    3)Titanium Berry

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This power up gives Pac some magnetic powers. He acts literally just like a magnet. This Power up also makes him get a cool metalic silver color and red and blue boxing gloves and shoes.</p>
